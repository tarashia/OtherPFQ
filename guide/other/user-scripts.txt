[h3]Userscripts[/h3][

]New update: I've moved my larger scripts to GitHub, and removed the old ones that are now in the QoL. The old script locations have been removed - this shouldn't break them, but you need to reinstall to get future updates.

[display="Keep track of nices"]Saves a copy of each nice you receive while this is running, and lets you display them using a button next to the nice count. Includes the user who sent it, and the time the script recorded it (may not be the time it was sent if you were afk).

[display="Hatch variety eggs tournament"]Keep track of eggs during the hatch variety eggs tournament. Tracks lab & shelter eggs automatically - must manually add daycare, supplier, etc. The list of eggs is stored locally on your browser, so if you use multiple devices you'll need to export your data manually.

Update: As of Nov 17, 2024 this *should* work with the lab changes. Default highlight now uses a blue border to avoid conflicts with the QoL - you can change this by setting the "newStyle" on line 18.
